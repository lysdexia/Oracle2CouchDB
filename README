DESCRIPTION: Copy an oracle table into a couchdb database
REQUIRES: python > 2.4 <3.0, cx_Oracle, couchdb

USAGE: Oracle2CouchDB

Edit the o2c.ini file, in the [oracle] section, supply your oracle
authentication values, the oracle table to be cloned and an optional
larger cursor_arraysize value. (A larger arraysize will often be 
advantageous when using fetchmany())
supply corresponding data for couchdb in the [couch] section

Future versions may allow user to enter all this on the command line.
For right now I suggest importing OraSuck and CouchBlow into a seperate
script. :-)

Oracle2CouchDB attempts to convert DATE objects to datetime.datetime.isoformat.

Also included is a pretty dirty script that I made for the CouchDB wiki:
    http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/DumpOracleDbToCouchDbPython

This one allows you to use unique values in an oracle table to create a CouchDB
database. It differs from the wiki version in that if you have a DATE object as
your unique key, the script will convert it to isoformat, since it makes sorting
and writing javascript views much simpler.

In my experience, I have found that either one works pretty well, but the nature
of converting from SQL tables it's generally okay to just let couchdb assign the
key. YMMV.

Have fun!
